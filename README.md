[Twittodon.com](https://twittodon.com) is a tool for verifying the connection between Mastodon and Twitter accounts. The goal is to create a publicly available database of such connections to make people's migration to Fediverse more pleasant by making it easier for them to recreate their Twitter networks. There are similar tools to this, but mine differs in that it is safe because it doesn't require you to provide credentials to 3rd-party apps.

This is a open-source project, so you can do whatever you want with it. You don't need to do that, but I will be pleased if you let me know if you have used any part of it :)
